vcloud-ruby
===========

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Ruby bindings to the VMware vCloud Director REST API

This is a work in progress, but it currently supports enough functionality to perform the entire Hello vCloud example in the [vCloud API Guide](http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vcd_15_api_guide.pdf).


INSTALL
-------

<pre>gem install vcloud</pre>


USAGE
-----

The examples/hello_vcloud.rb file demonstrates basic usage of the gem, for example...

```
require 'vcloud'
@session = VCloud::Client.new("https://my.vcloud.local/api/"), '1.5')
@session.login('someuser@someorg', 'secretp@ssw0rd)
@org = @session.get_org_from_name('myorg')
@catalog = @org.get_catalog_from_name('TestCatalog')
@vdc     = @org.get_vdc_from_name('TestVDC')
@catalog_item = @catalog.get_catalog_item_from_name('TestLinuxTemplate')
```

...and so on
